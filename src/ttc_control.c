 * @brief TTC (Time to Collision) and AEB (Autonomous Emergency Braking) control logic module.
 * 
 * This module provides core logic for calculating the time to collision (TTC) between a vehicle 
 * and an obstacle using a uniformly variable motion model. Based on the TTC and vehicle conditions, 
 * it optionally enables the Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) system and other related safety features.
 * 
 * The main functionalities include:
 * - Calculation of TTC based on relative speed, distance, and acceleration.
 * - Decision-making logic for enabling the AEB system, triggering alarms, locking seatbelts, and 
 *   unlocking doors in critical situations.

/**
 * @brief Calculate the time to collision (TTC) based on relative distance and speed.
 *
 * This function calculates the time to collision using the Uniformly Variable Motion (UVM) model. 
 * It uses a quadratic equation to calculate the time to collision (TTC) between two objects 
 * based on their relative distance and speed. If the relative acceleration is zero, the function 
 * simply calculates the time by dividing the relative distance by the relative speed [SwR-1] (@ref SwR-1), [SwR-10] 
 * (@ref SwR-10), [SwR-11] (@ref SwR-11). 
 *
 * @param dis_rel The relative distance between the objects in meters.
 * @param spd_rel The relative speed between the objects in km/h.
 * 
 * @return The time to collision in seconds. If no real solution is found (i.e., negative discriminant),
 *         the function returns -1.0. If there is no relative acceleration, the time to collision is calculated
 *         as distance divided by speed.

/**
 * @brief Controls the Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) system.
 * 
 * This function calculates the Time to Collision (TTC) based on the relative distance
 * and speed of the vehicle. If the TTC is below a certain threshold, the AEB system
 * triggers the alarm and may engage the braking system. It also prepares other safety 
 * features like seatbelt locking and door unlocking in critical conditions.
 * 
 * The decision is made based on predefined TTC thresholds:
 * - If the TTC is below the `THRESHOLD_ALARM` (e.g., 2 seconds), an alarm is triggered.
 * - If the TTC is below the `THRESHOLD_BRAKING` (e.g., 1 second), the braking system is activated.
 * - If the TTC is less than half of the braking threshold, the braking system is prepared for a collision.
 * 
 * The AEB system and the alarm are only triggered if the `enable_aeb` flag is set to true.
 * 
 * @param enable_aeb A pointer to a boolean flag that enables or disables the AEB system. [SwR-5] (@ref SwR-5)
 * @param alarm_cluster A pointer to a boolean flag that triggers the alarm in the cluster. [SwR-2] (@ref SwR-2)
 * @param enable_breaking A pointer to a boolean flag that enables or disables the braking system. [SwR-3] (@ref SwR-3)
 * @param lk_seatbelt A pointer to a boolean flag that locks the seatbelt in case of emergency. [Sys-F-14] 
 * @param lk_doors A pointer to a boolean flag that locks or unlocks the doors in an emergency. [Sys-F-14]
 * @param spd A pointer to the current speed of the vehicle (in km/h).
 * @param dist A pointer to the current distance to the obstacle (in meters).
 * 
 * @note The function complies with the requirements ([SwR-2] (@ref SwR-2), [SwR-3](@ref SwR-3), [SwR-5] (@ref SwR-5),
 *       SwR-11 (@ref SwR-11), SwR-14 (@ref SwR-14), SwR-15 (@ref SwR-15), Sys-F-8, Sys-F-9, Sys-F-14).
